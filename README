These are just my configuration files on emacs, together with some libraries that I use and are not versioned with ELPA.

You can clone and use it with:

    git clone git://github.com/Denommus/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d

When you first open emacs with these configurations, it will install for you all the packages that are being used. If you want to use additional packages from the package manager, set the auto-install-packages variable.
