These are just my configuration files on emacs, together with some libraries that I use and are not versioned with ELPA.

You can clone and use it with:

    git clone git://github.com/Denommus/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d

Some libraries must be manually installed for now. Later I'll make it automatic. I'll leave it as an exercise for you.
